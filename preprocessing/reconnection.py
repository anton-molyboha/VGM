       Suitable connection partners are found based on the following 
       cost-function (the individual parameters are explained below):
       Cost=A * distance / r_search +
            (1-A) * (1 - exp(-n angle / pi)) * (1-erf(distance / loop_diameter)
    INPUT: G: VascularGraph.
           r_search: The radius within which potential connection candidates are
                     searched for.
           costCutoff: Cost above which potential new edges are discarded.
           border: Distance to edge of domain within which endpoins are 
                   ignored.
           allowMultiple: The endpoints are treated sequentially. This boolean
                          decides whether an endpoint is deleated from the list
                          of endpoints once a connection has been made to it, 
                          or whether it should stay available for more
                          connections from other endpoints.
           A: Distance cost factor. The angle cost is (1-A), such that the 
              maximum cost possible is 1.0.
           n: Angle cost modulation factor.
           loop_diameter: The typical diameter of a vessel loop (beyond this 
                          distance, the influence of the connection angle is
                          negligible).

           **kwargs
           connType: The type of connection to be made between end-points. This
                     can be either 'linear' or 'spline'. (Default 'spline'.)
           splineOrder: The order of the splines to be fitted. (Default 3.)
           numEdgePoints: The number of edge points to create the spline 
                          (taking many points into account will yield a fit 
                          that matches the overall shape of the two 
                          ending-edges well, but may not produce a good fit at 
                          the endpoint vertices. The smaller the number of edge 
                          points, the better the match with the endpoint 
                          vertices, however the total number of points to
                          fit must always exceed the order of the spline).

           endpoints: A list of selected endpoint vertices to reconnect (useful
                      for testing purposes). All other enpoints serve only as
                      potential connection partners.
