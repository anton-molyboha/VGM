linearSystem_htd_TotFixedDT_NEW.py

renamed:
_nonCapDiv_add_RBCs_to_positionPref --> divergent_add_RBCs_to_positionPref:
because it is also used for capillaries

modified:
_CapDiv_compute_timeBlocked: list of prefXFull given as output,
because it is needed as input for outer if-conditions 

_CapDiv_add_blocked_RBC_to_positionPref: modified to be applicable where
there is only one possible outEdge left and the RBC is pushed backwards. 
Addtional output: boolFull

others:
- small modifications to reduce number of lines
- if boolTrifurcation and posNoBifEventsPrefX > countPrefX and prefXFull == 0:
	are combined now a combinded if-condition (instead of two individual ones)
