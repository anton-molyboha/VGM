"""
Vascular Graph Model (VGM)
==========================

VGM is a package for the simulation of cerebral blood flow in realistic
vascular networks. It makes use of the graph package iGraph to implement the
graph structure of the vasculature. Numpy and scipy are used extensively for
numerical manipulations. An algebraic multigrid solver is provided by PyAMG.
Matplotlib is used for 2D plots. 
Please consult the accompanying sphinx documentation for installation
instructions and tutorials. Moreover, the docstrings of modules, classes, and
functions should be helpful in understanding the code.
